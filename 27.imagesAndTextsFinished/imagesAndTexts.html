        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image1.jpg">To start off my dream garage, I'd have a 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera RS. As one of the best looking Porsches ever produced, the RS package includes a giant wing and front splitter, as well as huge weight reduction and 300 horsepower (a lot for a tiny car). This would be my new daily driver. </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image2.jpg"> The Ferrari Modena, an underrated super car made somewhat affordable on the used market. I would drive this car on weekends in the hills as a "romantic getaway" sort of car.</div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image3.jpg">The Audi RS2 Avant is a rally bred wagon. It’s a family car sitting on a dirt monster’s frame. This practical all-wheel drive cube would be my winter car.</div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image4.jpg">1970 Ford Mustang Mach 1. The pinnacle of first-generation Mustang design, I’d love to roll into a classic car meet with one of these, and eventually give it to my dad, who had several first gen Mustangs.</div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image5.jpg">In 1966 Ford won LeMans with their GT40, a historic victory for America. In 2016 They did it again with the new Ford GT, an insanely well engineered hypercar. 6 more years of innovation and we have the 2022 Ford GT heritage edition, wrapped to look like the original GT40 and worth half a million dollars. This would be a special occasion car for sure. </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image6.jpg">2001 Ford Lightning SVT. The Lightning SVT is a race pickup truck, quite an interesting combination, with the supercharged Triton V8 and 360 horsepower, this would be the perfect apocalypse truck. I’ve always been interested in Mad Max type scenarios, and if I was rich, I’d for sure have something like this armored up with a machine gun or something for fighting off zombie hordes.</div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image7.jpg">2001 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra. This is one of the rarest Cobras ever made. It's the Cobra variant of the Mustang I have, so it would be the obvious upgrade (considering I've had 3 of this year Mustang and each one has been an upgrade from the last). It's rare because this version of the Cobra was only produced in low numbers for 2 years before they swapped it out for the more powerful Terminator Cobra, which sold much better and had a front end redesign.</div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image8.jpg"> For another classic cruiser, I'd like a 1971 Ford Ranchero GT. It's a sedan with a truck bed, the less popular rival of the El Camino. I can see myself coasting down a nice oceanside road with the windows down, classic rock playing, maybe put some seats in the back and just have a nice picnic on the beach. </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image9.jpg"> The BMW M1 coupe is a homologation car, which means it was only commercially produced so BMW could use it in races. There were only 453 made, making this a collector's dream. It has a classic inline 6 BMW engine, and one of the best looking wedge designs ever sculpted. This car would be a joy to even look at in my garage.</div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image10.jpg"> Switching it up a little we have a 1990 Honda CBR250RR. This bike is famous for having one of the highest revving and best sounding engines ever put in a motorcycle. It has a 4 cylinder inline engine, and the cylinders are as small as shot glasses, allowing it to rev to 20,000 RPM.</div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image11.jpg"> This is a car I would definitely have gotten if I didn't develop a strange obsession with 4th gen Mustangs, the Toyota AW11 MR2. One of the first mass produced mid-engine cars. It's extremely light, has perfect weight distribution, and comes with a supercharged 4 cylinder. I think this could be one of the most fun cars you could buy, especially for winding roads. </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image12.jpg"> The 2025 Lotus Emira is sort of a more modern and luxurious take on the MR2 formula. It's mid engined, with a Toyota 4 cylinder, well balanced, and comes in a manual. The difference is that it has 400 horsepower and costs over $100,000. For sure a little pricey, but one of the most fun cars you can get new in the modern era of cars. </div>

		 <div class="text-box" data-bg="image13.jpg"> The last car would of course be my current daily driver, a "New Edge" 2002 Mustang GT in black. It has a 4.6 liter modular Romeo V8 and a 5 speed manual. The GT trim of this car is considered slow in comparison to modern sports cars, but I haven't driven a modern sports car, so to me it's the most fun thing in the world. It also has one of the best sounding exhaust tones from any V8, in my biased opinion. It always irritated me that all the other color codes had cool names like laser red or gunmetal gray but the black was just called black. The car came with V6 badging (prancing horse on the fenders) when it should have GT badges on the fenders, something only a crazed New Edge nut like me would notice. I would love to be able to keep this car forever, so hopefully my financial situation will allow me a multiple car lifestyle.  </div>
